Hon. Minister for Health inaugurates Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares) Taskforce,"The Minister for Health, Hon. Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has officially inaugurated the Ghana Medical Care Trust Fund (MahamaCares) Taskforce to oversee the successful implementation of the initiative.MahamaCares, an initiative of His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama, aims to provide dedicated financial support to individuals suffering from chronic and debilitating illnesses. The initiative is designed to ensure fairness in healthcare access, particularly for those facing financial barriers to treatment.Addressing the gathering, Hon. Akandoh highlighted that while the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has improved medical coverage, it does not completely ease the financial burden of treating chronic diseases. He stated, “The Ghana Medical Trust Fund is a bold response to this challenge. It’s purpose is clear: no Ghanaian should choose between their health and financial ruin.”He noted that the taskforce has been tasked with developing a strong policy and legal framework to establish MahamaCares as a statutory entity. In addition, the team will be responsible for designing a sustainable funding model to ensure the long-term viability of the fund, setting clear eligibility and disbursement criteria to guarantee fairness, and evaluating Ghana’s healthcare infrastructure to recommend improvements for better accessibility.Rev. Prof. Emeritus Seth Aryeetey, Chairman of the nine-member taskforce, expressed his immerse gratitude to the President and the Minister for the opportunity to serve. He assured that the taskforce would work diligently to ensure the success of the MahamaCares initiative and deliver on its mandate effectively.Other members of the taskforce include; Prof. Emeritus Binka – former Vice Chancellor of the University of Health and Allied Sciences, Prof. Margaret Kweku – Public Health Consultant,  Dr Alfred Doku – Consultant Cardiologist, Dr. Radolph Nsor-Ambala – financial expert, Dr Anthony Gingong – representative of the National Health Insurance Trust Fund, Dr. Anthony Seddoh – Health Policy and financing expert, Anna Pearl Akiwumi Siriboe – lawyer and the Attorney General’s representative for the committee and Dr Belinda Afriyie – Public Health Consultant Secretary for the Taskforce.Source: PR Unit Ministry of Health– P.O.Box M 44Sekou Toure AvenueNorth RidgeAdjacent National Health Insurance Head Office",,[],https://www.moh.gov.gh/hon-minister-for-health-inaugurated-ghana-medical-trust-fund-mahamacares-taskforce/,2025-07-09T14:34:48.714369

The majority (63%) of the population is aged between 18 and 64, with a small percentage (24%) falling below the 18 years bracket, and the rest are older adults (Kaiser Foundation Hospital Woodland Hills, 2016). The identified specific needs of this community are many, encompassing unprecedented rates of fast food overconsumption and numerous cases of cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. Other significant health issues affecting the region include cancer, road accidents, adult obesity as well and infant mortality. It is also worth mentioning that access to primary care is highly limited. Besides, the locals are considerably inactive and rarely exercise.

The Navrongo experiment tested ways of addressing inequities in the health system by mobilizing health sector and community resources. The KFH-Woodland Hills Medical Center service area is home to about 1,428,966 people. Regarding gender, 50,62% of the population are female, while the rest 49,38% are male. The region is characterized by a diverse community with the white being the majority (46%), followed by Latinos (33%), Asian (6%), and African American (2%). The majority (63%) of the population is aged between 18 and 64, with a small percentage (24%) falling below the 18 years bracket, and the rest are older adults (Kaiser Foundation Hospital Woodland Hills, 2016). The identified specific needs of this community are many, encompassing unprecedented rates of fast food overconsumption and numerous cases of cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. Other significant health issues affecting the region include cancer, road accidents, adult obesity as well and infant mortality. It is also worth mentioning that access to primary care is highly limited. Besides, the locals are considerably inactive and rarely exercise. Overall, the physical environment is unfavorable, exposing the population to various illnesses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these issues to provide its inhabitants with better health care services.",,[],http://ghanachps.org/,2025-07-09T14:41:48.101551
