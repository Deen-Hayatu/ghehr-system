The Regenerative Health and Nutrition (RHN) Programme is a new preventive and promotive health care programme initiated by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It aims to transform the health, lives and socioeconomic development of Ghanaians. It is a logical policy programme after health insurance. Its long term effect can bring about a reduction in the cost of lifestyle diseases such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Cancer, Gout and others which are currently on the increase. Lifestyle changes include what people eat and drink, and their physical activity levels, rest, and cleanliness. The programme draws on the experiences of an African Hebrew Community, living in Dimona, Israel and tries to adapt them to Ghana.

Akandoh emphasized the importance of fostering strong and cordial relationships between the Ministry and training institutions to ensure a well-coordinated and responsive healthcare system.He indicated that the purpose of the meeting was also to collaborate, discuss concerns, and find practical solutions that would benefit not only the institutions but also the Ghanaian people who rely on the healthcare system.The President of COHHETI, Madam Margaret Mary Alacoque welcomed the initiative, describing it as timely and necessary. She raised concerns about transportation challenges, accreditation delays, staffing shortages, and the general conditions and status of service for Health Training Institutions (HTIs).

Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, Minister for Health, has inaugurated the Ghana National Surgical, Obstetric, and Anesthesia Plan (NSOAP) Implementation Steering Committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, coordination, and monitoring of Ghana’s NSOAP.The Steering Committee unites together experts, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and development partners, whose collective knowledge and dedication will guide the successful implementation of this strategic plan.During the inauguration ceremony, Hon. Mintah Akandoh highlighted the committee’s role in providing the strategic direction necessary to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate our collective efforts to achieve the plan’s objectives.“The development of this plan is in line with our broader objectives for the health sector. It ensures that essential surgical, obstetric, and anesthesia services are incorporated into Ghana’s universal health coverage strategy. This is an important step toward reducing maternal and child mortality, effectively managing trauma cases, and strengthening emergency and critical care services throughout the country,” he said.The success of the NSOAP will not only strengthen our healthcare system but also save countless lives and ensure that every Ghanaian, regardless of their location or financial status, has access to quality surgical care. Hon. Mintah Akandoh called upon the committee members to approach their responsibility with a sense of urgency, commitment, and excellence.In response to the Minister, Prof. John Nkrumah Mills, the Chairman of the Committee, reassured the Minister and the entire Ministry that with the support of development partners, the resources provided, and cooperation from all stakeholders, the committee would successfully achieve Universal Health Care in the country.Prof. Nkrumah Mills pledged the committee’s dedication to delivering on its mandate and ensuring the provision of improving Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia management in the country.“We have to start right away, not to rush into implementing any programme but rather to plan, mobilize and strategize such that we make haste by not wasting time on minor issues, but by executing the NSOAP efficiently,” he added.Source: PR Unit Ministry of Health– P.O.Box M 44Sekou Toure AvenueNorth RidgeAdjacent National Health Insurance Head Office",

The consignment posed significant risks to public health, with the potential for widespread misuse and addiction, particularly among the youth.The destruction exercise took place at Vigour-DW Enterprise, a waste management specialist in Ashaiman, under the supervision of key regulatory and legal authorities. The operation was carried out in strict accordance with a court order.In a rare and symbolic demonstration of its resolve, the Ministry opted to publicly incinerate the drugs. Minister for Health, Hon. Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, emphasized that the action was not only to eliminate the harmful substances but also to send a strong warning to those engaged in the illegal drug trade.“We will not stop here. After the safe disposal of this consignment, we will further investigate the clearing agent and the importer, and hand them over to the Attorney General for prosecution,” he affirmed.The Minister also called on the public to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious drug-related activities to the authorities. “We all have a role to play in protecting our communities,” he said.He reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to keeping the public safe and continuing its efforts to safeguard the well-being of all citizens, as well as the productivity of the country.The event was witnessed by the Registrar of the High Court, representatives from the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), the Ministry of Health, and members of the media.The Ministry reiterated its commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of all citizens and sustaining the productivity and prosperity of the nation.Source: PR Unit Ministry of Health– P.O.Box M 44Sekou Toure AvenueNorth RidgeAdjacent National Health Insurance Head Office",

Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, to discuss potential collaborations in the health sector.The Ambassador highlighted several proposals from the Egyptian government, including providing accommodation for physicians inside or close to the hospital building.Additionally, H.E. Youseef expressed interest in bringing expert physicians and medical instruments on board but emphasized the need for the Ghanaian government to provide the necessary infrastructure.The establishment of pharmaceutical companies in Ghana was also proposed, with the Ambassador noting that proposals had already been made to some businessmen.However, the Ambassador mentioned that one of the challenges they face is the slow response time from the Ghanaian government.Hon. Akandoh in response acknowledged this challenge and assured the Ambassador that the President, H.E. John Dramani Mahama, is committed to the health sector.Given the current pressure on the government to provide funds for the health sector, Hon. Akandoh suggested that the Egyptian government take up the project in its entirety, including the construction of infrastructure and equipment.This, he explained, would be more feasible as the Ghanaian government is currently focused on completing old projects left by the previous administration.Hon. Akandoh appreciated the Egyptian government’s interest in collaborating with Ghana on health projects and advised them to bring more companies on board to help complete the project, noting that, it is a vital area of healthcare that the government would like to see thrive.Source: PR Unit Ministry of Health– P.O.Box M 44Sekou Toure AvenueNorth RidgeAdjacent National Health Insurance Head Office",

Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has officially inaugurated the Ghana Medical Care Trust Fund (MahamaCares) Taskforce to oversee the successful implementation of the initiative.MahamaCares, an initiative of His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama, aims to provide dedicated financial support to individuals suffering from chronic and debilitating illnesses. The initiative is designed to ensure fairness in healthcare access, particularly for those facing financial barriers to treatment.Addressing the gathering, Hon. Akandoh highlighted that while the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has improved medical coverage, it does not completely ease the financial burden of treating chronic diseases. He stated, “The Ghana Medical Trust Fund is a bold response to this challenge. It’s purpose is clear: no Ghanaian should choose between their health and financial ruin.”He noted that the taskforce has been tasked with developing a strong policy and legal framework to establish MahamaCares as a statutory entity. In addition, the team will be responsible for designing a sustainable funding model to ensure the long-term viability of the fund, setting clear eligibility and disbursement criteria to guarantee fairness, and evaluating Ghana’s healthcare infrastructure to recommend improvements for better accessibility.Rev. Prof. Emeritus Seth Aryeetey, Chairman of the nine-member taskforce, expressed his immerse gratitude to the President and the Minister for the opportunity to serve. He assured that the taskforce would work diligently to ensure the success of the MahamaCares initiative and deliver on its mandate effectively.Other members of the taskforce include; Prof. Emeritus Binka – former Vice Chancellor of the University of Health and Allied Sciences, Prof. Margaret Kweku – Public Health Consultant,  Dr Alfred Doku – Consultant Cardiologist, Dr. Radolph Nsor-Ambala – financial expert, Dr Anthony Gingong – representative of the National Health Insurance Trust Fund, Dr. Anthony Seddoh – Health Policy and financing expert, Anna Pearl Akiwumi Siriboe – lawyer and the Attorney General’s representative for the committee and Dr Belinda Afriyie – Public Health Consultant Secretary for the Taskforce.Source: PR Unit Ministry of Health– P.O.Box M 44Sekou Toure AvenueNorth RidgeAdjacent National Health Insurance Head Office",

You can use it as inspiration or guidance for your paper, or look at the high-quality papers we provide and order from us. CHPS moves health services to community locations, develops sustainable volunteerism and community health action, empowers women and vulnerable groups, and improves health provider, household, and community interaction. This program had origins in the activities and research findings of the Navrongo Health Research Centre (NHRC), which conducted a successful field experiment in the Kassena-Nankana District of the Upper East Region. The Navrongo experiment tested ways of addressing inequities in the health system by mobilizing health sector and community resources. The KFH-Woodland Hills Medical Center service area is home to about 1,428,966 people. Regarding gender, 50,62% of the population are female, while the rest 49,38% are male. The region is characterized by a diverse community with the white being the majority (46%), followed by Latinos (33%), Asian (6%), and African American (2%). The majority (63%) of the population is aged between 18 and 64, with a small percentage (24%) falling below the 18 years bracket, and the rest are older adults (Kaiser Foundation Hospital Woodland Hills, 2016). The identified specific needs of this community are many, encompassing unprecedented rates of fast food overconsumption and numerous cases of cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. Other significant health issues affecting the region include cancer, road accidents, adult obesity as well and infant mortality. It is also worth mentioning that access to primary care is highly limited. Besides, the locals are considerably inactive and rarely exercise. Overall, the physical environment is unfavorable, exposing the population to various illnesses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these issues to provide its inhabitants with better health care services.",
