## Project Overview

GhEHR is a comprehensive Electronic Health Records (EHR) system designed specifically for healthcare facilities in Ghana. This MVP focuses on essential healthcare management features with considerations for low-literacy users and offline capabilities.

## Architecture

## Core Features (MVP)

1. **Patient Management**
   - Digital registration with demographics and medical history
   - Unique patient IDs to prevent duplicates
   - Search and filtering capabilities

2. **Clinical Records**
   - Doctor's notes and diagnoses with AI-powered analysis
   - Ghana-specific medical AI for condition detection and treatment recommendations
   - Real-time symptom extraction and confidence scoring
   - Prescription management with templates for common diseases (malaria, etc.)
   - Lab/test result integration (manual upload initially)

3. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - Calendar view for healthcare providers
   - WhatsApp-first appointment booking system
   - SMS reminders for patients with automated follow-ups
   - Voice-based appointment confirmation for low-literacy users

4. **Billing & Payments**
   - Invoice generation and tracking
   - Mobile Money integration (future feature)

5. **Basic Reporting**
   - Daily patient counts
   - Revenue summaries
   - Basic analytics

## Advanced Features (Enhanced System)

6. **AI-Powered Clinical Notes** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
   - Ghana Medical NLP for real-time medical text analysis
   - Automatic detection of common Ghana diseases (malaria, typhoid, TB, hypertension, diabetes)
   - Symptom extraction with keyword matching algorithms
   - Confidence scoring (0-1 scale) for condition suggestions
   - Treatment recommendations based on detected conditions
   - Culturally appropriate UI with Adinkra symbols
   - Debounced real-time analysis to prevent excessive API calls

7. **WhatsApp-First Appointment System** ðŸš§ **PLANNED**
   - WhatsApp bot integration using whatsapp-web.js
   - Natural language appointment booking via WhatsApp messages
   - QR code patient verification system
   - Automated appointment confirmations and reminders
   - Multi-language support (English, Twi, Ga)

8. **Offline Mode with Auto-Sync** ðŸš§ **PLANNED**
   - IndexedDB implementation for local data storage
   - Background synchronization when connectivity returns
   - Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - Local storage of critical patient data

9. **Voice Notes and Speech Integration** ðŸš§ **PLANNED**
   - Speech-to-text for clinical note taking
   - Voice commands for low-literacy healthcare workers
   - Audio recording with automatic transcription
   - Multi-language speech recognition (English, Twi, Ga)

10. **Enhanced SMS and Communication** ðŸš§ **PLANNED**
    - Twilio integration for appointment reminders
    - Automated follow-up messages for missed appointments
    - Health education messages in local languages
    - Emergency alert system for critical patient conditions

## Design Principles

- **Low-Literacy UI**: Use icons, minimal text, support for Swahili/Twi languages
- **Data Export**: PDF/Excel export capabilities for compliance
- **Offline Mode**: Sync-able local storage for areas with poor internet
- **Security**: HIPAA-like compliance for data protection
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple clinics and healthcare facilities

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Include comprehensive logging
- Write unit and integration tests
- Follow REST API conventions
- Implement proper database migrations
- Use proper security headers and CORS configuration

## Key Libraries and Dependencies

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form management
- React Query for state management
- Lodash for utility functions (debounce, throttle)
- IndexedDB for offline storage (planned)

### Backend
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Helmet for security headers
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT authentication
- express-validator for input validation
- Multer for file uploads
- Morgan for logging
- WhatsApp Web.js for WhatsApp integration (planned)
- Twilio SDK for SMS functionality (planned)
- Natural language processing libraries for medical AI

## Database Schema Considerations

- Patients: demographics, medical history, unique identifiers
- Medical Records: notes, diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results
- Appointments: scheduling, provider assignment, status tracking
- Billing: invoices, payments, insurance information
- Users: healthcare providers, administrators, authentication data
- Audit Logs: track all data access and modifications for compliance
- Clinical Notes: AI analysis results, confidence scores, symptom extraction
- AI Insights: condition suggestions, treatment recommendations, analysis history

## AI Implementation Details

### Ghana Medical NLP System
- **Location**: `backend/src/routes/clinicalNotes.ts`
- **Functionality**: Analyzes clinical text for Ghana-specific medical conditions
- **Supported Conditions**: Malaria, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Hypertension, Diabetes, Asthma, Malnutrition, Dengue Fever, Meningitis
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/notes` - Create clinical notes
  - `GET /api/notes` - Retrieve clinical notes by patient
  - `POST /api/notes/analyze` - Real-time medical text analysis
- **Features**:
  - Keyword-based symptom extraction
  - Confidence scoring algorithm (0-1 scale)
  - Treatment recommendations for detected conditions
  - Debounced real-time analysis in frontend
  - Cultural sensitivity for Ghana healthcare context

## Security Requirements

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Log all data access for audit trails
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Data backup and disaster recovery procedures

When working on this project, prioritize data security, user experience for low-literacy users, and offline functionality. The AI-powered clinical notes system is fully implemented and ready for use. Focus on expanding WhatsApp integration, offline capabilities, and voice features for the next development phase.
