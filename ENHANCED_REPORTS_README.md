- **Patient Search**: Debounced search (300ms) with autocomplete functionality
- **Export Options**: Both PDF and Excel format downloads
- **Date Filtering**: Customizable date ranges for all reports
- **Role-based Access**: Admin reports restricted to admin/doctor roles
- **Ghana Localization**: DD/MM/YYYY date format, GHS currency
- **Responsive Design**: Material-UI components for mobile compatibility

### Backend API Endpoints
4. **routes/reports.ts** - Added 9 new endpoints
   - `/api/reports/admin/summary` - Appointment summary reports
   - `/api/reports/admin/details` - Detailed appointment reports
   - `/api/reports/admin/visits` - Visit summary reports
   - `/api/reports/admin/booked` - Booked appointments reports
   - `/api/reports/admin/lists` - Patient lists reports
   - `/api/reports/patient/clinical` - Clinical details reports
   - `/api/reports/patient/prescription` - Prescription reports
   - `/api/reports/patient/test` - Test order reports
   - `/api/reports/patient/vaccine` - Vaccine history reports

5. **routes/patients.ts** - Added patient search endpoint
   - `/api/patients/search` - Patient search for reports with autocomplete

### Dependencies Added
- **xlsx** - Excel file generation library
- **@types/xlsx** - TypeScript definitions for xlsx

## Key Technical Implementations

### 1. TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
// Admin Report Parameters
interface ReportParams {
  reportType: AdminReportType;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'excel';
  doctor?: string;
  status?: string;
}

// Patient Report Parameters  
interface PatientReportParams {
  reportType: PatientReportType;
  patientId: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'excel';
}
```

### 2. Mock Data Generation
- Comprehensive mock data for all report types
- Ghana-specific content (diseases, medications, doctors)
- Realistic date ranges and patient information
- Currency formatting in Ghana Cedis (GHS)

### 3. File Download Implementation
```typescript
// PDF/Excel generation with proper headers
const handleDownload = async () => {
  const blob = await onGenerate(params);
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const link = document.createElement('a');
  link.href = url;
  link.download = filename;
  link.click();
};
```

### 4. Patient Search with Debouncing
```typescript
// 300ms debounced search implementation
const debouncedSearch = useCallback(
  debounce(async (searchValue: string) => {
    if (searchValue.length >= 2) {
      const results = await patientSearch(searchValue);
      setPatientOptions(results);
    }
  }, 300),
  [patientSearch]
);
```

## Navigation Structure

```

## API Integration
- All endpoints return mock data for MVP functionality
- PDF generation using PDFKit library
- Excel generation using xlsx library
- Proper HTTP headers for file downloads
- Error handling and user feedback

## Security & Access Control
- JWT token authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control for admin reports
- Facility-based data filtering
- Patient search scoped to user's facility

## Ghana Healthcare Context
- Date formats in DD/MM/YYYY (Ghana standard)
- Currency in Ghana Cedis (GHS)
- Common local diseases (Malaria, Hypertension)
- Local medication names and treatments
- Ghana healthcare provider workflow integration

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- No compilation errors in backend/frontend
- Material-UI component consistency
- Responsive design testing
- Mock data validation

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Database Integration**: Replace mock data with actual database queries
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filter options for date ranges and criteria
3. **Charts & Visualizations**: Graphical representations of report data
4. **Scheduled Reports**: Automated report generation and delivery
5. **Custom Report Builder**: User-defined report templates
6. **Print Optimization**: Enhanced print layouts for physical documents
7. **Report Caching**: Performance optimization for large datasets
8. **Multi-language Support**: Local language translations
