# GhEHR Local Development to GitHub Workflow

## Summary: Should I Commit My Local Development Changes to GitHub?

**YES, you should commit your local development changes to GitHub,** but with a structured approach:

1. **Use Feature Branches** - Never commit directly to main or development branches
2. **Commit Frequently** - Small, logical commits make tracking and reverting changes easier
3. **Push Regularly** - Push to GitHub to back up your work and share with the team
4. **Clean Before Committing** - Use the pre-commit-check.sh script to ensure code quality

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Start Your Day with a Fresh Pull

```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
```

### 2. Create or Continue on a Feature Branch

```bash
# New feature
git checkout -b feature/patient-search

# OR continuing work
git checkout feature/patient-search
git pull origin feature/patient-search  # If branch exists remotely
```

### 3. Make Changes and Test Locally

Follow the process in LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md:
- Make code changes
- Run local servers
- Test functionality
- Verify with test cases

### 4. Check Code Quality Before Committing

```bash
# Run our custom pre-commit check
bash pre-commit-check.sh
```

### 5. Commit Logically and Frequently

```bash
# Stage specific files (preferred over git add .)
git add file1.ts file2.ts

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "[PatientManagement] Add NHIS validation logic"
```

### 6. Push to GitHub Regularly

```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/patient-search
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request When Ready

When your feature is complete:
1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
2. Request code reviews from appropriate team members
3. Address any feedback
4. Merge to development branch after approval

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Backup**: Your work is saved in GitHub, not just your local machine
- **Collaboration**: Team members can see your progress and provide feedback
- **Traceability**: Changes are documented with meaningful commit messages
- **Quality**: Code reviews ensure high-quality code makes it to production
- **Safety**: Feature branches keep experimental work separate from stable code

## Tools to Help

1. **pre-commit-check.sh**: A script to verify your code is ready to commit
2. **GIT_WORKFLOW.md**: Detailed Git workflow guidelines
3. **GITHUB_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md**: Best practices for GitHub contributions
4. **GIT_WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md**: Visual representation of the workflow

## Remember

- **Test thoroughly** before creating pull requests
- **Keep commits focused** on single concerns
- **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain why changes were made
- **Never commit sensitive data** like API keys or patient information
- **Reference issue numbers** in commit messages when applicable

By following this workflow, you'll ensure that your local development changes are properly managed, backed up, and integrated into the project in a structured way.
