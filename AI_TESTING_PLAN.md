# GhEHR AI-Powered Clinical Notes Testing Plan

## Overview

The AI-powered Clinical Notes system is one of GhEHR's key differentiating features. This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for this component, focusing on Ghana-specific medical NLP capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before testing:
1. Ensure backend is running: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Ensure frontend is running: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Login to the system with valid credentials

## Test Cases for Ghana Medical NLP

### 1. Real-Time Medical Text Analysis

**Test Case 1.1: Basic Symptom Analysis**
1. Navigate to Clinical Notes section
2. Select an existing patient or create a new one
3. Start typing a clinical note with common symptoms of malaria:
   ```
   Patient presents with fever, headache, and joint pains for the last 3 days. Has also experienced chills and sweating at night.
   ```
4. Expected Result:
   - The system should detect and highlight these symptoms
   - "Malaria" should appear in the suggested conditions with high confidence
   - The AI analysis panel should show extracted symptoms: fever, headache, joint pains, chills, sweating

**Test Case 1.2: Local Terminology Recognition**
1. Create a new clinical note using local Ghanaian terms:
   ```
   Patient complains of atiridii (feeling cold/hot), body aches, and says they have maleria (local term for malaria).
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - The system should recognize "atiridii" and "maleria" as related to malaria
   - "Malaria" should appear in the suggested conditions with reasonable confidence

**Test Case 1.3: Multiple Condition Detection**
1. Create a clinical note with symptoms of multiple conditions:
   ```
   Patient presents with cough with blood, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue for past month. Also reports high blood pressure readings at home.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - The system should suggest tuberculosis with high confidence
   - Hypertension should also be suggested but with lower confidence
   - Extracted symptoms should include: cough with blood, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, high blood pressure

### 2. Confidence Scoring

**Test Case 2.1: High-Confidence Scenario**
1. Create a note with very specific symptoms of a single condition:
   ```
   Patient has severe headache, neck stiffness, fever, and sensitivity to light. Cannot touch chin to chest. Vomiting started this morning.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - "Meningitis" should be suggested with very high confidence (>0.8)
   - Severity should be marked as "severe" or "critical"
   - The UI should visually emphasize the high-confidence condition

**Test Case 2.2: Medium-Confidence Scenario**
1. Create a note with some but not all typical symptoms:
   ```
   Patient reports increased thirst and frequent urination over the past month. No weight loss or vision changes noted.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - "Diabetes" should be suggested with medium confidence (0.4-0.7)
   - Other conditions might also be suggested with lower confidence

**Test Case 2.3: Low-Confidence/Ambiguous Scenario**
1. Create a note with general, non-specific symptoms:
   ```
   Patient complains of fatigue and general weakness. No other specific symptoms noted.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - Multiple conditions might be suggested but all with low confidence (<0.4)
   - The system should indicate the uncertainty and not make strong recommendations

### 3. Treatment Recommendations

**Test Case 3.1: Malaria Treatment**
1. Create a note with clear malaria symptoms:
   ```
   Patient presents with cyclical fever, chills, and headache for 4 days. Lives in endemic area with poor mosquito protection.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - Treatment recommendations should include:
     - Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
     - Paracetamol for fever and pain
     - Advice for fluid intake
     - Mosquito net usage guidance

**Test Case 3.2: Tuberculosis Treatment**
1. Create a note with TB symptoms:
   ```
   Patient has persistent cough with blood-streaked sputum for over 3 weeks, significant weight loss, and night sweats.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - Treatment recommendations should include:
     - Referral for TB testing/confirmation
     - Standard TB medication regimen mention
     - Isolation measures
     - Follow-up protocol

**Test Case 3.3: Chronic Disease Management**
1. Create a note for hypertension:
   ```
   Patient has consistently elevated blood pressure readings of 160/95 mmHg over several visits. Complains of occasional headaches.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - Treatment recommendations should include:
     - Antihypertensive medication options
     - Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise)
     - Regular blood pressure monitoring
     - Follow-up schedule

### 4. Cultural Sensitivity

**Test Case 4.1: Cultural Considerations**
1. Create a note with cultural context:
   ```
   Patient believes their illness is connected to spiritual causes but is willing to take medication. Shows symptoms of fever and cough.
   ```
2. Expected Result:
   - The system should provide medical recommendations while acknowledging cultural beliefs
   - No dismissive language about traditional beliefs
   - Focus on complementary approach to treatment

### 5. UI/UX Testing

**Test Case 5.1: Real-Time Analysis**
1. Slowly type a clinical note, pausing between sentences
2. Expected Result:
   - The analysis should update as you type (with debounce)
   - Performance should remain smooth without freezing
   - Changes in predictions should be visible as more symptoms are added

**Test Case 5.2: Saving and Loading Analysis**
1. Create a note with AI analysis
2. Save the note
3. Close and reopen the note
4. Expected Result:
   - Saved note should retain all AI analysis data
   - Condition suggestions, confidence scores, and extracted symptoms should persist

**Test Case 5.3: Visual Indicators**
1. Create notes triggering different confidence levels
2. Expected Result:
   - High-confidence conditions should be visually distinct (perhaps green/bold)
   - Medium-confidence conditions should have appropriate visual treatment
   - Low-confidence conditions should be visually de-emphasized or marked as uncertain

### 6. Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Test Case 6.1: Very Long Clinical Notes**
1. Create an exceptionally long clinical note (copy/paste multiple paragraphs)
2. Expected Result:
   - System should handle the large text volume without crashing
   - Analysis should still complete in a reasonable time
   - UI should remain responsive

**Test Case 6.2: Network Issues**
1. Create a note while temporarily disconnecting from the network
2. Expected Result:
   - Appropriate error handling/messaging
   - No UI crash
   - Optional: Local caching of the note until connectivity is restored

**Test Case 6.3: Mixed Languages**
1. Create a note with mixed English and local Ghanaian language terms
2. Expected Result:
   - System should still identify recognizable symptoms and conditions
   - No errors from non-English text processing

## Reporting Issues

For each failed test case:
1. Take a screenshot of the issue
2. Note the exact text input that caused the problem
3. Document the expected vs. actual behavior
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Document browser/environment details

## Expected AI Performance Metrics

- Detection accuracy for Ghana priority diseases:
  - Malaria: >90% with specific symptoms
  - Tuberculosis: >85% with specific symptoms
  - Hypertension/Diabetes: >80% with specific symptoms
- False positive rate: <15% for high-confidence predictions
- Analysis speed: Results within 500ms after debounce for typical notes
- UI responsiveness: No noticeable lag during typing

Remember that the AI system is designed to assist healthcare providers, not replace clinical judgment. Testing should verify that the system presents information as suggestions rather than definitive diagnoses.
