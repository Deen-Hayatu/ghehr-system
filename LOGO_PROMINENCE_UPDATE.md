# Logo Prominence Update - Complete! ✅

## 🎯 **Logo Visibility Enhancement**

Successfully updated the GhEHR system to prominently display **only the logo image** across all pages, removing text and symbols for maximum visual impact.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 1. **GhEHRLogo Component Updated**
- **Default behavior**: Now shows only the logo image (no text)
- **Default variant**: Changed from `'full'` to `'icon'` 
- **Default showText**: Changed from `true` to `false`
- **Flexibility**: Text variants still available when explicitly requested

```tsx
// Before: Logo with text by default
<GhEHRLogo size={40} />  // Showed logo + "GhEHR" text

// After: Clean logo only by default  
<GhEHRLogo size={40} />  // Shows only the logo image

// Text still available when needed
<GhEHRLogo size={40} variant="full" showText={true} />
```

### 2. **Adinkra Symbols Removed from Headers**
Removed decorative Adinkra symbols from clinical module headers to let the logo stand out:

- ✅ **ClinicalNotes.tsx** - Removed `Dwennimmen` symbol
- ✅ **AppointmentManagement.tsx** - Removed `Sankofa` symbol  
- ✅ **PatientRegistration.tsx** - Removed `GyeNyame` symbol
- ✅ **PatientManagement.tsx** - Removed `GyeNyame` symbol
- ✅ **Dashboard.tsx** - Removed `Sankofa` symbol from welcome message

**Note**: Kept cultural symbols in MOH government sections (`MOHDashboard`, `MOHContactInfo`) as they're appropriate for official/compliance contexts.

## 🎨 **Visual Impact**

### **Before:**
```
[Logo] [Icon] GhEHR Text [Adinkra Symbol]
```

### **After:**
```
[Logo] Clean Header Text
```
